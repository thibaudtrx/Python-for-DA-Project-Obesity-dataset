# Python-for-DA-Project-Obesity-dataset

The goal of this project is to predict someone's obesity level from a given dataset.
During this project I had to clean the dataset, change the structure of the dataset, make visualizations, and do machine learning.
This project contains :
- a Jupiter Notebook 
- a Django API
- a Powerpoint explaining the problem.

Finally, the best machine learning algorithm to predict someoneâ€™s obesity level is SVC, with 0.959828 of accuracy.
